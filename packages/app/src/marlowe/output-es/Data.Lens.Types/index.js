// | This module defines types for working with lenses.
// |
// | All optics have their normal name (e.g. `Lens`)
// | and one whose name is prefixed with either "A"
// | or "An" (e.g. `ALens`). Prefixed versions avoid the
// | issue of "impredicativity". To understand that concept
// | more and why prefixed names are sometimes necessary,
// | see the `./docs` folder.
